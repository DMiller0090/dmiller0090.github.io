	<h2>What is a marimba?</h2>
		<p>
			Marimbas are keyboard instruments. They have wooden bars suspended by string on hooks over tubes called <em>resonators</em>. The resonators help add warmth and depth when striking the bars with yarn mallets.

	<p>This website has many uses of scripts. I really like the layout of the head and body. The styling in CSS is obviously well done. My page certainly lacks coherent structure and styling.</p>
